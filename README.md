# The Comic Collecting and Pull List App

**Bag-n-Burn lets you manage your physical comic collection, your wish, and pull lists, all on your phone or tablet, any time.**

Add comics quickly by selecting a cover image, or taking a photo, and tapping in a few brief details. Comes back later and add more information as and when you choose.

No need to dig through long boxes in the loft to enjoy your collection, with bag-n-burn you can flick through all that great cover art any time you like.

Keep tabs on your wish and pull lists wherever you are. Snap a photo of anything you want to pick up in the future, or mark a comic to burn if you want a reminder to drop it from your pull list.
